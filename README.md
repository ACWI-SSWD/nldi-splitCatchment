# nldi-splitCatchment
The purpose of this application is to prove a method for splitting a local NHD Plus v2 catchment at a click point.  The application inputs are an X,Y coordinate, and the NHD Plus v2 flow direction raster.  It also utilizes several calls to USGS NLDI services.

####  Pre-requisites
* Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) 
* Install required packages
```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda create -n split-catchment python=3.8 pyproj requests pyflwdir rasterio shapely ## for pyflwdir
```

#### Get dependecies
Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/marsmith/nldi-splitCatchment
```

##  Get Started
You should now be able to run the script at a predefined sample site by running: 
```
conda activate split-catchment
python ./nldi_delineate_pyflwdir.py
```

##  Flask Setup
Install flask dependecies
```
conda install flask flask-cors
```

Steps to start flask dev server:

* start miniconda (start button, type 'mini' it should come up)  
* type `conda activate split-catchment`
* navigate to d:\applications\ss-delineate
* type `set FLASK_APP=app.py`
* run flask app `flask run`
* open index.html in a browser to test with flask app
